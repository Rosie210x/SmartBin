**SmartBin – IoT‑Enabled Smart Trash Bin**

**Description**
SmartBin is an IoT‑based waste management system powered by ESP32 and integrated with the Blynk IoT platform. It combines sensors and actuators to automate lid control, monitor trash levels, and detect harmful gases, while providing real‑time alerts and data visualization on a mobile dashboard.

**Features**
- Automatic Lid Control
Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects (e.g., a hand) and triggers a servo motor to open the lid. The lid closes automatically after a short delay.
- Trash Level Monitoring
An ultrasonic or infrared sensor measures how full the bin is and calculates the fill percentage.
- Full Bin Alerts
When the bin reaches a defined threshold, the system sends notifications via the Blynk app/dashboard.
- Air Quality Monitoring
An MQ‑135 gas sensor measures smoke or harmful gases inside the bin. If levels exceed safe limits, the system activates a buzzer and sends a critical alert.
- Cloud Connectivity
Real‑time data is sent to the Blynk platform, where users can monitor fill level, lid status, and air quality from anywhere.

**Hardware Components**

- ESP32 Development Board
- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC‑SR04) – for object detection & trash level
- IR Sensor (optional) – for additional fill detection
- MQ‑135 Gas Sensor – for smoke/air quality
- Servo Motor – for lid actuation
- Buzzer & LED – for alerts
- Power Supply (Battery/Adapter)
- Supporting electronics (resistors, wires, breadboard/PCB)

**Software & Cloud**
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO for firmware development
- Blynk IoT App for dashboard, notifications, and remote monitoring

**How It Works**
- Approach the bin → Ultrasonic detects your hand → Servo opens lid.
- After a delay → Servo closes lid automatically.
- Trash level measured → Fill percentage calculated and sent to Blynk.
- If bin is full → LED + buzzer alert + push notification.
- Gas detected → MQ‑135 triggers buzzer + Blynk event notification.

**Blynk Dashboard**
- V0 → Trash Fill Level (%)
- V1 → Smoke/Gas PPM
- V2 → LED Indicator (Safe/Moderate/Danger)
- V3 → Distance (Front Sensor)
- V4 → Servo Lid Position

**Future Improvements
**- Solar‑powered version for outdoor use
- Integration with municipal waste collection systems
- Machine learning for predictive fill‑level alerts
